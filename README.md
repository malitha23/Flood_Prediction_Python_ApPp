# Flood Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the probability of floods in various regions using deep learning techniques. It is part of the "Regression with a Flood Prediction Dataset" competition from Kaggle's Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 5. The model developed here uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to learn from environmental and socioeconomic data and predict flood risks.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a deep neural network.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for handling missing values, outlier removal, feature scaling, and data transformation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uses visualization tools to understand data distribution and relationships.
- **Real-time Prediction**: A Flask-based web application allows users to input data and get real-time flood probability predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, Git

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment tool (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flood-prediction.git
   cd flood-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install required packages:

If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can generate it using:

bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Then install the packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to use the application.

Usage
Data Input: Enter the required features in the web form.
Predict: Click the 'Predict' button to see the flood probability.
Output: The app will display whether you are in danger of flooding and the probability score.
Model Training
The model is trained on the train.csv dataset.
The training process includes handling outliers, feature scaling, and using a deep neural network architecture.
The model is evaluated using the R2 score.
Results
The final model achieved satisfactory performance, with an R2 score indicating its ability to predict flood probabilities accurately. It demonstrated the effectiveness of using deep learning techniques for environmental risk assessment.

Future Improvements
Enhance model accuracy by experimenting with more advanced architectures like LSTM or CNN.
Integrate additional features or datasets that might affect flood prediction.
Improve the web application's user interface and user experience.
